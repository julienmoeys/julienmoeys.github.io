Technical aspects   <a id="technicalAspects"></a>
-----------------

### Website generator

This website is generated with the open source, static site-generator 
[Jekyll][] (by [Tom Preston-Werner][]), with the template [Poole][] 
and its theme [Lanyon][] (by [@mdo][mdo])

The website content is generated from simple text files written 
with the [markdown][] syntax. The source code is 
[version controlled][Software_versioning] and can be found on my 
[Github][] repository [julienmoeys.github.io][]

<!-- 
    The main reason for adopting [Jekyll][] site generator is that:

    *   the generated website is [static][Static_web_page], and thus 
        much less susceptible to security [vulnerabilities][Vulnerability] 
        (less than dynamic [Content Management Systems][CMS]) and does 
        not require PhP or MySQL to be rendered.

    *   the website sources are mostly human readable text files, that 
        can be version controlled.

    *   the website is lightweight and this accessible to most 
        computers.
