Technical aspects
-----------------

### Website generator

This website is generated with the open source, static site-generator 
[Jekyll][] (by [Tom Preston-Werner][]), with the template [Poole][] 
and its theme [Lanyon][] (by [@mdo][mdo])

The website content is generated from simple text files written 
with the [markdown][] syntax. The source code is version controlled
and can be found on my [Github][] repository [julienmoeys.github.io][]

The main reason for adopting Jekyll site generator is that:

*   the generated website is static, and thus much less susceptible 
    to security vulnerabilities (less than dynamic websites like 
    Content Management Systems) and does not require PhP or 
    MySQL to run.

*   the website sources are mostly human readable text files, that 
    can be version controlled.

*   the website is lightweight and this accessible to most 
    computers.


### Webhosting
