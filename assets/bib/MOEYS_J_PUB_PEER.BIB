  abstract = {Assessing climate change impacts on pesticide leaching requires careful
	consideration of different sources of uncertainty. We investigated
	the uncertainty related to climate scenario input and its importance
	relative to parameter uncertainty of the pesticide leaching model.
	The pesticide fate model MACRO was calibrated against a comprehensive
	one-year field data set for a well-structured clay soil in south-western
	Sweden. We obtained an ensemble of 56 acceptable parameter sets that
	represented the parameter uncertainty. Nine different climate model
	projections of the regional climate model RCA3 were available as
	driven by different combinations of global climate models (GCM),
	greenhouse gas emission scenarios and initial states of the GCM.
	The future time series of weather data used to drive the MACRO model
	were generated by scaling a reference climate data set (1970–1999)
	for an important agricultural production area in south-western Sweden
	based on monthly change factors for 2070–2099. 30 yr simulations
	were performed for different combinations of pesticide properties
	and application seasons. Our analysis showed that both the magnitude
	and the direction of predicted change in pesticide leaching from
	present to future depended strongly on the particular climate scenario.
	The effect of parameter uncertainty was of major importance for simulating
	absolute pesticide losses, whereas the climate uncertainty was relatively
	more important for predictions of changes of pesticide losses from
	present to future. The climate uncertainty should be accounted for
	by applying an ensemble of different climate scenarios. The aggregated
	ensemble prediction based on both acceptable parameterizations and
	different climate scenarios has the potential to provide robust probabilistic
	estimates of future pesticide losses.},

  abstract = {The assessment of climate change impacts on pesticide leaching requires
	a careful consideration of both parameter uncertainty and model structural
	error. Our aim was to assess (i) model structure uncertainty, with
	specific focus on the effects of temperature on pesticide sorption
	and diffusion, and its relation to parameter uncertainty and (ii)
	the importance of these sources of uncertainty in long-term predictions
	of pesticide leaching in the perspective of climate change. We introduced
	optional functions describing the effects of temperature on sorption
	and diffusion into the pesticide fate and transport model MACRO5.2,
	which resulted in four structurally different versions. The generalised
	likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method was applied to these
	four structurally different model versions in order to generate an
	ensemble of acceptable parameter combinations for long-term predictions
	of pesticide leaching under climate change. The analysis was performed
	in a two-step procedure. First, for each model version, 80,000 parameter
	combinations were tested against a comprehensive field data set of
	bromide and bentazone concentrations in drainflow and in the soil
	profile to identify acceptable parameter combinations. In a second
	step, we performed 30-year predictions based on these acceptable
	parameter sets for three hypothetical compounds that differed in
	their sorption strength. The period 1970–1999 was used to represent
	the current climate for a region in south-west Sweden. The future
	climate time series was derived for the period 2070–2099 by perturbing
	the observed time series based on monthly change factors calculated
	from climate projections of the regional climate model RCA3 with
	boundary conditions of the global circulation model ECHAM5 forced
	by the A2-emission scenario. For all three pesticide compounds, total
	losses were predicted to increase for autumn applications due to
	projected increases in winter rainfall, but decrease for spring applications.
	Differences between model versions were found, despite the large
	uncertainty in parameter estimates. Thus, temperature dependent diffusion
	was shown to be important for weakly sorbed compounds, while inclusion
	of temperature dependent sorption significantly affected the predictions
	for moderately and strongly sorbed compounds. The response to climate
	change was consistent for the different model versions, but the models
	that included temperature dependent sorption showed relatively more
	leaching in a future climate. Our findings stressed the importance
	of considering temperature dependent processes when modelling future
	pesticide losses.},

  pages = {5571-5584},
  number = {19},
  abstract = {The use of empirical relationships to calibrate remotely sensed data
	has been reported by many authors, but few studies have been devoted
	to the specific retrieval of soil reflectance and most studies have
	used two calibration targets only, using few (=5) validation targets
	to assess the error in the empirical relationships. Absolute corrections
	based on empirical line methods have seldom been applied to satellite
	data, particularly Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)
	images. In this study, which deals with bare cultivated soils, the
	empirical line method was used to retrieve soil reflectance from
	three programmed SPOT satellite images with 20m and 10m resolution
	based on independent sets of 8 calibration and 15 validation field
	targets of bare soil. The empirical line method was applied to orthorectified
	images with digital number (DN) values interpolated both with the
	cubic convolution and the nearest neighbour interpolation mode. Root
	mean squared errors (RMSEs) between corrected and measured values
	at calibration sites were lower than 0.56% for the two visible bands
	and ranged between 0.61% and 1.97% for the near-infrared band, whereas
	at all validation sites they were mostly lower than 2.5% except for
	most near-infrared bands. Such accurate results have been facilitated
	both by the flat topographical conditions of the Beauce region (Western
	Parisian Basin, France) and the homogeneous sky conditions in a small
	study area (2500ha). Differences in illumination conditions in both
	orbital and field cases did not appear to affect the results dramatically,
	which suggest that even oblique viewing images can be used for such
	correction. Errors could also be due to changes in soil moisture
	and roughness related to soil management practices, or slight vegetation
	growth over the end of the study period. Due to spatial error, the
	20-m resolution with cubic convolution mode led to a much lower performance
	than the 10-m images with either interpolation modes. The achieved
	results are generalizable to European sedimentary basins with loess
	deposits, where similar soils and topographic conditions are to be
	found over thousands of km(2).},

  abstract = {[FR] La cartographie des sols est une étape incontournable pour de
	nombreux travaux d'évaluation agronomique et environnementale. Les
	méthodes de prospection, qui reposent en grande partie sur l'expertise
	de terrain des pédologues, sont aujourd'hui très proches des travaux
	formalisés il y a plus de 30 ans. De nouveaux outils sont venus récemment
	renforcer la "panoplie" du pédologue. Nous avons testé l'un d'eux,
	la mesure de la résistivité électrique apparente du sol par l'outil
	MUCEP, sur une parcelle de 22 ha en Beauce chartraine. Cet appareil
	tracté permet une mesure quasi-simultanée pour des écartements inter-électrodes
	de 50, 100 et 200 cm. Nous avons intégré cette mesure géophysique
	au travail de cartographie des sols de la parcelle. Cette intégration
	s'est déroulée en plusieurs étapes. Après avoir utilisé les contrastes
	révélés par la mesure de résistivité pour orienter la prospection
	pédologique, nous avons procédé à une analyse statistique des corrélations
	entre les variables pédologiques et la résistivité électrique apparente.
	Le paramètre utilisé est le coefficient de corrélation bisériale.
	Ce dernier nous a permis de comparer simultanément l'effet des variables
	pédologiques quantitatives et qualitatives sur la résistivité. Il
	en ressort que la mesure de la résistivité électrique apparente est
	liée à de nombreuses propriétés du sol. Alors que la résistivité
	des écartements 50 cm et 100 cm est surtout sensible à la pierrosité
	de surface et à la profondeur d'apparition du calcaire, la résistivité
	de l'écartement 200 cm est d'abord sensible à la profondeur d'apparition
	du niveau argileux. Le résultat de cette analyse statistique a été
	exploité lors du tracé des limites entre les unités cartographiques
	de sol, en suivant un schéma de décision explicite. Ce dernier permet
	d'adapter localement, et au cas par cas, l'utilisation de la mesure
	de résistivité combinée au jugement d'expert. Cette étude montre
	que la mesure de résistivité électrique apparente MUCEP, complétée
	par une analyse statistique simple, peut apporter un gain de précision
	au travail de cartographie des sols. Ce constat est d'autant plus
	intéressant que le contexte géo-pédologique de cette étude est peu
	favorable au pédologue comme au géophysicien. Mots clés : cartographie

	cartography is an essential stage for agronomical or environmental
	evaluations. Nowadays, prospecting methods, which mainly rely on
	the field expertise of soil scientists, are very similar to those
	formalised more than 30 years ago. Nevertheless, new devices have
	recently been added to the soil scientist toolbox. We have tested
	one of them, the measurement of soil electrical apparent resistivity
	with the MUCEP device (figure 2), on a 22 ha plot in the "Beauce
	chartraine" region in France (figure 1). The MUCEP is a pulled-device
	that allows quasi-simultaneous measurements at 50, 100 and 200 cm
	inter-electrodes spacings. We have introduced this geophysical measurement
	(figure 5) into the soil mapping process. This integration was conducted
	in several steps. After using the resistivity contrasts to direct
	auger holes prospection (table 1), we have conducted a statistical
	analysis of the correlations between pedological variables and the
	apparent resistivity by using the point biserial correlation coefficient
	(figure 3, table 4). It makes it possible to simultaneously compare
	the effects of quantitative and qualitative pedological variables
	on resistivity. We demonstrated that apparent resistivity was correlated
	to many soil properties: whereas the resistivity measured with 50
	and 100 cm spacing was mainly correlated to the stone content at
	the soil surface and the depth of limestone, the resistivity measured
	with 200 cm spacing was mainly correlated to the clay layer depth.
	These results were used for plotting the limits between the soil
	map units, according to an explicit decision tree (figure 6) that
	combines, case by case, the use of resistivity measurements with
	expert judgement. The use of point biserial correlation coefficient
	makes it possible to take into account important qualitative variables
	that couldn't be integrated in Pearson correlation coefficient (table
	2) or linear regression analysis (table C). This study shows that
	the measurement of the soil electrical apparent resistivity with
	MUCEP, together with a simple statistical analysis can provide a
	gain in precision to the soil mapping process (figure 7). This statement
	is of specific interest in the studied geo-pedological context that
	was not favourable for both the soil scientist (figure 4) and the
	geophysicist.},
