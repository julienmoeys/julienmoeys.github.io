  abstract = {The Panel has interpreted the Terms of Reference as a stepwise analysis
	of issues relevant to both the development and the evaluation of
	models to assess ecological effects of pesticides. The regulatory
	model should be selected or developed to address the relevant specific
	protection goal. The basis of good modelling practice must be the
	knowledge of relevant processes and the availability of data of sufficient
	quality. The opinion identifies several critical steps in order to
	set models within risk assessment, namely: problem formulation, considering
	the specific protection goals for the taxa or functional groups of
	concern; model domain of applicability, which drives the species
	and scenarios to model; species (and life stage) selection, considering
	relevant life history traits and toxicological/toxicokinetics characteristics
	of the pesticide; selection of the environmental scenario, which
	is defined by a combination of abiotic, biotic and agronomic parameters
	to provide a realistic worst-case situation. Model development should
	follow the modelling cycle, in which every step has to be fully documented:
	(i) problem definition; (ii) model formulation, i.e. design of a
	conceptual model; (iii) model formalisation, in which variables and
	parameters are linked together into mathematical equations or algorithms;
	(iv) model implementation, in which a computer code is produced and
	verified; (v) model setup, including sensitivity analysis, uncertainty
	analysis and comparison with observed data, that delivers the regulatory
	model; (vi) prior to actual use in risk assessment, the regulatory
	model should be evaluated for relevance to the specific protection
	goals; (vii) feedback from risk assessor with possible recommendations
	for model improvement. Model evaluation by regulatory authorities
	should consider each step of the modelling cycle: the opinion identifies
	points of particular attention for the use of mechanistic effect
	models in pesticide risk assessment. It is recommended that models
	be documented in a complete and transparent way, that a feedback
	platform be established involving risk assessors and model developers,
	and that a set of agreed models be made available.

  abstract = {Abstract The potential of ecological models for supporting environmental
	decision making is increasingly acknowledged. However, it often remains
	unclear whether a model is realistic and reliable enough. Good practice
	for developing and testing ecological models has not yet been established.
	Therefore, TRACE, a general framework for documenting a model's rationale,
	design, and testing was recently suggested. Originally \{TRACE\}
	was aimed at documenting good modelling practice. However, the word
	‘documentation’ does not convey TRACE's urgency. Therefore, we re-define
	\{TRACE\} as a tool for planning, performing, and documenting good
	modelling practice. \{TRACE\} documents should provide convincing
	evidence that a model was thoughtfully designed, correctly implemented,
	thoroughly tested, well understood, and appropriately used for its
	intended purpose. \{TRACE\} documents link the science underlying
	a model to its application, thereby also linking modellers and model
	users, for example stakeholders, decision makers, and developers
	of policies. We report on first experiences in producing \{TRACE\}
	documents. We found that the original idea underlying \{TRACE\} was
	valid, but to make its use more coherent and efficient, an update
	of its structure and more specific guidance for its use are needed.
	The updated \{TRACE\} format follows the recently developed framework
	of model ‘evaludation’: the entire process of establishing model
	quality and credibility throughout all stages of model development,
	analysis, and application. \{TRACE\} thus becomes a tool for planning,
	documenting, and assessing model evaludation, which includes understanding
	the rationale behind a model and its envisaged use. We introduce
	the new structure and revised terminology of \{TRACE\} and provide
	examples. },

  abstract = {Models are increasingly being relied upon to inform and support natural
	resource management. They are incorporating an ever broader range
	of disciplines and now often confront people without strong quantitative
	or model-building backgrounds. These trends imply a need for wider
	awareness of what constitutes good model-development practice, including
	reporting of models to users and sceptical review of models by users.
	To this end the paper outlines ten basic steps of good, disciplined
	model practice. The aim is to develop purposeful, credible models
	from data and prior knowledge, in consort with end-users, with every
	stage open to critical review and revision. Best practice entails
	identifying clearly the clients and objectives of the modelling exercise;
	documenting the nature (quantity, quality, limitations) of the data
	used to construct and test the model; providing a strong rationale
	for the choice of model family and features (encompassing review
	of alternative approaches); justifying the techniques used to calibrate
	the model; serious analysis, testing and discussion of model performance;
	and making a resultant statement of model assumptions, utility, accuracy,
	limitations, and scope for improvement. In natural resource management
	applications, these steps will be a learning process, even a partnership,
	between model developers, clients and other interested parties. },

	Some scientists argue, with reference to Popper's scientific philosophical
	school, that models cannot be verified or validated. Other scientists
	and many practitioners nevertheless use these terms, but with very
	different meanings. As a result of an increasing number of examples
	of model malpractice and mistrust to the credibility of models, several
	modelling guidelines are being elaborated in recent years with the
	aim of improving the quality of modelling studies. This gap between
	the views and the lack of consensus experienced in the scientific
	community and the strongly perceived need for commonly agreed modelling
	guidelines is constraining the optimal use and benefits of models.
	This paper proposes a framework for quality assurance guidelines,
	including a consistent terminology and a foundation for a methodology
	bridging the gap between scientific philosophy and pragmatic modelling.
	A distinction is made between the conceptual model, the model code
	and the site-specific model. A conceptual model is subject to confirmation
	or falsification like scientific theories. A model code may be verified
	within given ranges of applicability and ranges of accuracy, but
	it can never be universally verified. Similarly, a model may be validated,
	but only with reference to site-specific applications and to pre-specified
	performance (accuracy) criteria. Thus, a model's validity will always
	be limited in terms of space, time, boundary conditions and types
	of application. This implies a continuous interaction between manager
	and modeller in order to establish suitable accuracy criteria and
	predictions associated with uncertainty analysis},

	Quality assurance (QA) is defined as protocols and guidelines to support
	the proper application of models. In the water management context
	we classify QA guidelines according to how much focus is put on the
	dialogue between the modeller and the water manager as: (Type 1)
	Internal technical guidelines developed and used internally by the
	modeller's organisation; (Type 2) Public technical guidelines developed
	in a public consensus building process; and (Type 3) Public interactive
	guidelines developed as public guidelines to promote and regulate
	the interaction between the modeller and the water manager throughout
	the modelling process. State-of-the-art QA practices vary considerably
	between different modelling domains and countries. It is suggested
	that these differences can be explained by the scientific maturity
	of the underlying discipline and differences in modelling markets
	in terms of volume of jobs outsourced and level of competition. The
	structure and key aspects of new generic guidelines and a set of
	electronically based supporting tools that are under development
	within the HarmoniQuA project are presented. Model credibility can
	be enhanced by a proper modeller-manager dialogue, rigorous validation
	tests against independent data, uncertainty assessments, and peer
	reviews of a model at various stages throughout its development},
