	Some scientists argue, with reference to Popper's scientific philosophical
	school, that models cannot be verified or validated. Other scientists
	and many practitioners nevertheless use these terms, but with very
	different meanings. As a result of an increasing number of examples
	of model malpractice and mistrust to the credibility of models, several
	modelling guidelines are being elaborated in recent years with the
	aim of improving the quality of modelling studies. This gap between
	the views and the lack of consensus experienced in the scientific
	community and the strongly perceived need for commonly agreed modelling
	guidelines is constraining the optimal use and benefits of models.
	This paper proposes a framework for quality assurance guidelines,
	including a consistent terminology and a foundation for a methodology
	bridging the gap between scientific philosophy and pragmatic modelling.
	A distinction is made between the conceptual model, the model code
	and the site-specific model. A conceptual model is subject to confirmation
	or falsification like scientific theories. A model code may be verified
	within given ranges of applicability and ranges of accuracy, but
	it can never be universally verified. Similarly, a model may be validated,
	but only with reference to site-specific applications and to pre-specified
	performance (accuracy) criteria. Thus, a model's validity will always
	be limited in terms of space, time, boundary conditions and types
	of application. This implies a continuous interaction between manager
	and modeller in order to establish suitable accuracy criteria and
	predictions associated with uncertainty analysis},

	Quality assurance (QA) is defined as protocols and guidelines to support
	the proper application of models. In the water management context
	we classify QA guidelines according to how much focus is put on the
	dialogue between the modeller and the water manager as: (Type 1)
	Internal technical guidelines developed and used internally by the
	modeller's organisation; (Type 2) Public technical guidelines developed
	in a public consensus building process; and (Type 3) Public interactive
	guidelines developed as public guidelines to promote and regulate
	the interaction between the modeller and the water manager throughout
	the modelling process. State-of-the-art QA practices vary considerably
	between different modelling domains and countries. It is suggested
	that these differences can be explained by the scientific maturity
	of the underlying discipline and differences in modelling markets
	in terms of volume of jobs outsourced and level of competition. The
	structure and key aspects of new generic guidelines and a set of
	electronically based supporting tools that are under development
	within the HarmoniQuA project are presented. Model credibility can
	be enhanced by a proper modeller-manager dialogue, rigorous validation
	tests against independent data, uncertainty assessments, and peer
	reviews of a model at various stages throughout its development},
