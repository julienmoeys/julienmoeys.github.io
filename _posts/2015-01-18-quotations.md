This document lists some of the [quotation][]s I like (quotations 
that are relevant for the work I am doing, or related to science). 
This page is updated from time to time.



Statistics   <a id="stats"></a>
==========

The statistics questions and answers site [Cross 
Validated][CrossValidated] has an excellent entry 
about [Famous statistician quotes][famousStatQuote].



Ronald Fisher
-------------

About [Ronald Fisher][RonaldFisher].

> To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be 
> no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: 
> he may be able to say what the experiment died of.

1938

See the above mentioned page on "Cross Validated".



Informatics   <a id="informatics"></a>
===========

For many more quotes on software engineers, see the page [Quotes 
for Software Engineers][SEQuotes] (by Rajapakse DC).

Maurice Wilkes
--------------

About [Maurice Wilkes][MauriceWilkes].

> In 1949 as soon as we started programming we found to our surprise 
> that it wasn’t as easy to get programs right as we had thought. 
> Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant 
> when I realised that a large part of my life from then on was going 
> to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.

Wilkes, M. V. (1985). Memoirs of a computer pioneer. Cambridge, 
Mass: MIT Press. See [this article][MauriceWilkes] of the Daily 
Telegraph, citing this quotation.



Solomon W. Golomb   <a id="golomb"></a>
-----------------

About [Solomon W Golomb][SolomonWGolomb].

> Don't apply a model until you understand the simplifying assumptions 
> on which it is based and can test their applicability.

> Distinguish at all times between the model and the real world. 

> You will never strike oil by drilling through the map!

> Don’t expect that by having named a demon you have destroyed him.

> The purpose of notation and terminology should be to enhance 
> insight and facilitate computation – not to impress or confuse 
> the uninitiated

I found this citation in a [presentation given by Karl Johan 
Åström][KJAstrom] at a seminar in Collège de France 
(Seminar organised by Gérard Berry, available online). The original 
paper is: Golomb, SOLOMON W. "[Mathematical models: Uses and limitations
][MathModel]." Reliability, IEEE Transactions on 20, no. 3 
(1971): 130-131.

Note: _I haven't been able to check the quotation myself, and I 
have found numerous variations around Solomon W Golomb quotations 
(some might be more accurate than others)._



Gérard Berry
------------

About [Gérard Berry][GerardBerry].

> Informatics, in the present state a the titanic fight between
> two absolutely opposite components: [...]
> The man [_here Kepler_] who is clever, rigorous [...] and slow. [...]
> and the computer [...] which is superfast, superexact and superstupid.

Lecture "Getting Rid of Bugs" (2010), from the seminar series "Seven 
Keys to the Digital Future", Edinburgh, UK, September 23rd-October 
6th 2010. The video [is available online][GettingRid] (See also 
[Gérard Berry's homepage][GerardBerry]).

The same citation, as [a transcript of the same lecture][SevenKeys2]:

> The problem with computers [...], is the gulf between computers 
> and the people who program them. While people are clever,
> only semi-rigorous and slow at performing computations, computers 
> are superfast, superexact and superstupid – and this leads to
> a "titanic fight" between machines and humans



Douglas Bates
-------------

About [Douglas Bates][DouglasBates].

> Maybe I’ll become a theoretician. Nobody expects you to maintain 
> a theorem.

September 2013, [R fortunes][RFortunes] #356 



Fred P. Brooks
--------------

About [Fred P. Brooks][FredBrooks].

> adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.

This quotation is know as [Brooks's law][BrookssLaw].

In F.P. Brooks, Jr. "The Mythical Man-Month". 1975. Addison-Wesley.

Engineers][SEQuotes].



Ralph Johnson
-------------

About [Ralph Johnson][RalphJohnson].

> Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.

I have not been able to find the exact reference of this quote.



Geography and spatial data analysis   <a id="geography"></a>
===================================

Alfred Korzybski
----------------

About [Alfred Korzybski][AlfredKorzybski].

> The map is not the territory

1931, meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science in New Orleans, Louisiana. See [this Wikipedia 
page][mapterritory].

See also a similar citation ("[drilling through the map](#golomb)") 
by Solomon W. Golomb.



Risk Management   <a id="risk"></a>
===============

Sven Ove Hansson
----------------

About [Sven Ove Hansson][SOHansson]

> In issues of risk, like all other social issues, the role of the
> expert is to investigate facts and options, not to make decisions
> or to misrepresent facts in a unidimensional way that leaves the
> decision-maker no choice. 

_and further:_

> Science without precaution means acting too little and too late 
> against environmental hazards. Precaution without science means 
> acting with the wrong priorities. What we need is science-based 
> precaution

In: Hansson, Sven Ove. "Seven myths of risk." _Risk Management_ 
(2005): 7-17.
