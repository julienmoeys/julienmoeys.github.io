![A field of cereals in spring]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/20120427_24-c-m2-s_wheat.jpg "A field of cereals in spring")

My work focusses on **understanding and modelling pesticide fate 
in arable soils**, and up-scaling at the **landscape scale**. I 
use recent research developments to provide **practical solutions** 
to evaluate the **risks of pesticide release in the environments**.

My work is quite **multidisciplinary** (pedology, agronomy, 
soil-physics, statistics, _etc._) and requires an important 
'technical' investment for **handling efficiently the large amounts 
of data** used and produced by the programs we run. **Databases and 
programming techniques** are quite central to my work. 

I work for the [Centre for Chemical Pesticides (CKB)][CKB] (_about 
60-70% of my time_), a [SLU][]-hosted **competence and expertise 
centre**, supporting Swedish authorities and professional organisations\* 
regarding the **environmental impacts of pesticides** (\*: [KemI][], 
[JV][], [NV][], [HaV][], [Water Authorities][], [municipalities][], 
[LRF][] and [SV][]). 

I develop a new modelling toolbox, **[MACRO-SE][]**, for estimating 
the risks of pesticide losses at the regional-scale, in the 21 
[counties of Sweden][]. [MACRO-SE][] 'toolbox' consists of several 
sub-parts: 

1.  the **model** itself (with [MACRO][] as a workhorse); 
2.  county-scale agro-environmental **geo-datasets** (soil maps, 
    crop statistics, _etc._) needed to feed the model; 
3.  a collection of **parametrisation routines** (also called 
    _[pedotransfer functions][PTF]_) and; 
4.  a low-tech IT infrastructure (computers, database-server) for 
    distributing the calculations. 

I also work on various **research projects** (_about 25-35% of my 
time_), as a support for **modelling**, **data-management** 
(programming, databases) and **data-analysis** (statistics). I am 
participating in a research project (PERFORM) with several French 
research institutions, on modelling the impact of innovative 'low 
input' farming practices on pesticide leaching risks (a project 
led by [INRA][] [EGC][]).

The remaining (_5%_) of my time I [teach](/CV/#teaching) in two different 
**courses**, mostly computer-based modelling exercise in Soil Physics 
(water flow).

I am an **[open source][]** enthusiast, and think research publications, 
research software and public data should be _as much as possible_ 
cost-free and allowing copy, study, and changes without restrictions 
other than authors' [attribution][]).
