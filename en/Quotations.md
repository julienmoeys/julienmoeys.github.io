This document lists some of the [quotation][]s I like (quotations 
that are relevant for the work I am doing, or related to science). 

Topics: [Informatics](#informatics) | [Geography and spatial data 
analysis](#geography)



Informatics   <a name="informatics"></a>
===========

Maurice Wilkes
--------------

> In 1949 as soon as we started programming we found to our surprise 
> that it wasn’t as easy to get programs right as we had thought. 
> Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant 
> when I realised that a large part of my life from then on was going 
> to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.

See [this article][MauriceWilkes] of the Daily Telegraph.



Solomon W. Golomb   <a name="golomb"></a>
-----------------

About [Solomon W Golomb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_W._Golomb).

> Don't apply a model until you understand the simplifying assumptions 
> on which it is based and can test their applicability.

> Distinguish at all times between the model and the real world. 

> You will never strike oil by drilling through the map!

> Don’t expect that by having named a demon you have destroyed him.

> The purpose of notation and terminology should be to enhance 
> insight and facilitate computation – not to impress or confuse 
> the uninitiated

I found this citation in a [presentation given by Karl Johan 
Åström][KJAstrom] at a seminar in Collège de France 
(Seminar organised by Gérard Berry, available online). The original 
paper is: Golomb, SOLOMON W. "[Mathematical models: Uses and limitations
][SolomonGolomb]." Reliability, IEEE Transactions on 20, no. 3 
(1971): 130-131.

Note: _I haven't been able to check the quotation myself, and I 
have found numerous variations around Solomon W Golomb quotations 
(some might be more accurate than others)._



Gérard Berry
------------

About [Gérard Berry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_Berry).

> Informatics, in the present state a the titanic fight between
> two absolutely opposite components: [...]
> The man [here Kepler] who is clever, rigorous [...] and slow. [...]
> The computer [...] which is superfast, superexact and superstupid.

Lecture "Getting Rid of Bugs" (2010), from the seminar series "Seven 
Keys to the Digital Future", Edinburgh, UK, September 23rd-October 
6th 2010. The video [is available online][GettingRid] (See also 
[Gérard Berry's homepage][GerardBerry]).

The same citation, as [a transcript of the same lecture][SevenKeys2]:

> The problem with computers [...], is the gulf between computers 
> and the people who program them. While people are clever,
> only semi-rigorous and slow at performing computations, computers 
> are superfast, superexact and superstupid – and this leads to
> a "titanic fight" between machines and humans

> Maybe I’ll become a theoretician. Nobody expects you to maintain 
> a theorem.
