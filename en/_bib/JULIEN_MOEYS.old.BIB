  abstract = {Prediction of pesticide fate in soils is highly sensitive to parameters
	describing sorption and degradation processes, namely the Koc partioning
	coefficient between the soil solution and organic carbon fraction
	and the half-life DT50 for degradation. This paper explores the impact
	of getting Koc and DT50 values either from databases or from site-specific
	measurements on the predicted fate of atrazine, isoproturon and metamitron
	on the catchment scale. Pesticide fate on the scale of the Bruyères-et-Montbérault
	catchment, France, was predicted using the SEAMS software that couples
	a one-dimensional local-scale model of pesticide fate to a geographic
	information system. The results show that the use of database average
	values for Koc and DT50 underestimates the average risk of pesticide
	leaching calculated from site-specific Koc and DT50 values, whereas
	maximised risk scenarios based on extreme Koc and DT50 values may
	be overestimated when using database values. Whenever available,
	site-specific data should be preferred to limit bias in pesticide
	leaching risk assessments on the catchment scale.},

  abstract = { Currently, no general guidance is available on suitable approaches
	for dealing with spatial variation in the first-order pesticide degradation
	rate constant k even though it is a very sensitive parameter and
	often highly variable at the field, catchment, and regional scales.
	Supported by some mechanistic reasoning, we propose a simple general
	modeling approach to predict k from the sorption constant, which
	reflects bioavailability, and easily measurable surrogate variables
	for microbial biomass/activity (organic carbon and clay contents).
	The soil depth was also explicitly included as an additional predictor
	variable. This approach was tested in a meta-analysis of available
	literature data using bootstrapped partial least-squares regression.
	It explained 73% of the variation in k for the 19 pesticide–study
	combinations (n = 212) in the database. When 4 of the 19 pesticide–study
	combinations were excluded (n = 169), the approach explained 80%
	of the variation in the degradation rate constant. We conclude that
	the approach shows promise as an effective way to account for the
	effects of bioavailability and microbial activity on microbial pesticide
	degradation in large-scale model applications. },

  abstract = {The extent to which a fast, nonequilibrium, and highly transient pore-scale
	process such as macropore flow can be predicted is very often debated,
	although little research has been conducted to investigate this issue.
	The validity of approaches to "upscaling" transport predictions from
	pore through Darcy to landscape scales critically depends on the
	answer to this question. We developed a simple conceptual model of
	soil susceptibility to macropore flow, based on a synthesis of existing
	experimental information. The conceptual model takes the form of
	a decision tree, which classifies soil horizons into one of four
	susceptibility classes on the basis of easily available site and
	soil factors. The model was tested against an independent database
	of tracer breakthrough experiments on undisturbed soil columns collated
	from the literature (n = 52), using the pore volumes drained at peak
	solute concentration, t(p), as a measure of the strength of macropore
	flow. Analysis of variance for t(p) as a function of susceptibility
	class showed that the overall model was significant. A significant
	proportion of the residual variation in t(p) could be attributed
	to variation in clay content within one of the susceptibility classes.
	Some important sources of experimental error were also Identified
	that may account for much of the remaining unexplained variation.
	We concluded that macropore flow is predictable to a sufficient degree
	from easily available soil properties and site factors. The simple
	classification tree developed in this study could be used to support
	hydropedological approaches to quantifying the spatial distribution
	of contaminant leaching at the landscape scale by providing the basis
	for class pedotransfer functions to estimate model parameters related
	to macropore flow. Such an approach has been implemented in the European
	project FOOTPRINT.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the solute transport characteristics of soils at field
	and catchment scales is important for sustainable management of environmental
	and agricultural resources. It is known that preferential flow and
	solute transport through macropores often contribute substantially
	to the transport of diffuse pollutants to groundwater or surface
	water via drains. As direct measurement of preferential flow parameters
	is expensive and time consuming, more easily obtainable soil properties
	must instead be used as surrogates to predict preferential flow,
	using so-called pedotransfer functions (PTFs). However, there is
	evidence that the soil properties used in classical PTFs (soil texture,
	bulk density, fraction of organic matter) are not sufficient to infer
	the flow and transport characteristics of near-saturated and saturated
	soils (e.g. Weynants, M. et al., 2009. Revisiting Vereecken Pedotransfer
	Functions: Introducing a Closed-Form Hydraulic Model. Vadose Zone
	Journal 8: 86-95). Rather, the incorporation of additional data such
	as land use, soil-biota, and soil-type information appears to be
	necessary (e.g. Jarvis, N. J. et al., 2009. A conceptual model of
	soil susceptibility to macropore flow. Vadose Zone Journal 8: 902-910).
	In this study, we make use of a database comprising results of breakthrough
	curve experiments and corresponding site (parent material, climate,
	land use, etc.) and soil properties (texture, bulk density, etc.)
	published in the peer-reviewed literature to identify through statistical
	analyses (e.g. factorial and cluster analysis) the key soil properties
	and site attributes that control susceptibility to preferential flow.}

	therefore investigated 17 distinct nonparametric measures of solute
	breakthrough curve (BTC) shape using a data set of 115 tracer BTCs
	sampled from the literature. We tested the shape measures for sensitivity
	to deconvolution approaches based on Gaussian, lognormal, and gamma
	probability density functions and the mobile–immobile model. Furthermore,
	we evaluated collinearities among the 17 shape measures. Most deconvolution
	approaches gave very good fits to the data, with coefficients of
	determination larger than 0.98. Dual-domain transfer functions were
	superior to single-domain ones, even after accounting for measures
	of parsimony. The least sensitive shape measures were the normalized
	first temporal moment, the mean transport velocity, the apparent
	dispersion coefficient, and the relative arrival time of the first
	5 and 85% of the tracer mass. In contrast, the skewness and kurtosis
	were most sensitive to the choice of deconvolution approach, even
	for BTC experiments with very long data series of more than eight
	water-filled pore volumes. The relative arrival time of the first
	5% of the tracer mass was identified as the most robust shape parameter
	that could serve as an indicator of preferential flow and transport.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sorption coefficients (the linear KD or the non-linear
	KF and NF) are critical parameters in models of pesticide transport
	to groundwater or surface water. In this work, a dataset of isoproturon
	sorption coefficients and corresponding soil properties (264 KD and
	55 KF) was compiled, and pedotransfer functions were built for predicting
	isoproturon sorption in soils and vadose zone materials. These were
	benchmarked against various other prediction methods.RESULTS: The
	results show that the organic carbon content (OC) and pH are the
	two main soil properties influencing isoproturon KD. The pedotransfer
	function is KD = 1.7822 + 0.0162 OC1.5 − 0.1958 pH (KD in L kg−1
	and OC in g kg−1). For low-OC soils (OC < 6.15 g kg−1), clay and
	pH are most influential. The pedotransfer function is then KD = 0.9980
	+ 0.0002 clay − 0.0990 pH (clay in g kg−1). Benchmarking KD estimations
	showed that functions calibrated on more specific subsets of the
	data perform better on these subsets than functions calibrated on
	larger subsets.CONCLUSION: Predicting isoproturon sorption in soils
	in unsampled locations should rely, whenever possible, and by order
	of preference, on (a) site- or soil-specific pedotransfer functions,
	(b) pedotransfer functions calibrated on a large dataset, (c) KOC
	values calculated on a large dataset or (d) KOC values taken from

	the development of a full set of PTF’s to completely parameterise
	the pesticide fate model MACRO from only easily available site and
	soil data for a range of European agronomic, climatic and pedological
	scenarios The work presented here aimed at assessing the performance
	of the parameterisation procedures developed in the FOOTPRINT project
	for MACRO, from a functional point of view. We present a comparison
	of measured and simulated tracer leaching in medium- to long-term
	(2 months to 2 years) experiments driven by natural-transient rainfall
	conditions on 41 lysimeters, representing 15 soil types, located
	in Sweden, UK and France. For each experiment, the only information
	used to parameterize the model was a soil profile description, in
	which each horizon is characterized by its thickness, FAO master
	horizon type, texture class, organic carbon content and bulk density
	and knowledge of the tillage (till, no-till, harrowed) and cropping
	practices (crop type, and sowing dates). The average depth of the
	lysimeters was 1 meter, each profile containing an average of 4.6
	horizons. The soil properties covered a large range of textures (1
	to 78% clay), organic matter contents (0 to 29%) and bulk densities
	(550 to 1870 kg.m-3). Simulations were first conducted without any
	calibration of parameters. In a second step, we conducted simulations
	where two crop parameters were optimized (root depth and root water
	uptake efficiency), in order to estimate the impact of errors in
	the simulated water balance on solute leaching predictions. For each
	simulation, we computed a series of statistics (RMSE, model efficiency)
	to assess the quality of the prediction for water flow, tracer leaching
	and tracer concentrations in the outflow. The contribution of bias
	to the simulation errors was estimated. Both sorted and non-sorted
	results have been used to compare measured and simulated ‘solute
	flow’ time series and distribution (time-independent). Conclusions
	are drawn concerning strengths, weaknesses and biases of the set

	méthodes de prospection, qui reposent en grande partie sur l?expertise
	de terrain des pédologues, sont aujourd?hui très proches des travaux
	formalisés il y a plus de 30 ans. De nouveaux outils sont venus récemment
	renforcer la panoplie du pédologue. Nous avons testé l?un d?eux,
	la mesure de la résistivité électrique apparente du sol par l?outil
	MUCEP, sur une parcelle de 22 ha en Beauce chartraine. Cet appareil
	tracté permet une mesure quasi-simultanée pour des écartements inter-électrodes
	de 50, 100 et 200 cm. Nous avons intégré cette mesure géophysique
	au travail de cartographie des sols de la parcelle. Cette intégration
	s?est déroulée en plusieurs étapes. Après avoir utilisé les contrastes
	révélés par la mesure de résistivité pour orienter la prospection
	pédologique, nous avons procédé à  une analyse statistique des corrélations
	entre les variables pédologiques et la résistivité électrique apparente.
	Le paramètre utilisé est le coefficient de corrélation bisériale.
	Ce dernier nous a permis de comparer simultanément l?effet des variables
	pédologiques quantitatives et qualitatives sur la résistivité. Il
	en ressort que la mesure de la résistivité électrique apparente est
	liée à  de nombreuses propriétés du sol. Alors que la résistivité
	des écartements 50 cm et 100 cm est surtout sensible à  la pierrosité
	de surface et à  la profondeur d?apparition du calcaire, la résistivité
	de l?écartement 200 cm est d?abord sensible à  la profondeur d?apparition
	du niveau argileux. Le résultat de cette analyse statistique a été

	par une analyse statistique simple, peut apporter un gain de précision
	au travail de cartographie des sols. Ce constat est d?autant plus

	cartography is an essential stage for agronomical or environmental
	evaluations. Nowadays, prospecting methods, which mainly rely on
	the field expertise of soil scientists, are very similar to those
	formalised more than 30 years ago. Nevertheless, new devices have
	recently been added to the soil scientist toolbox. We have tested
	one of them, the measurement of soil electrical apparent resistivity
	with the MUCEP device (figure 2), on a 22 ha plot in the ?Beauce
	chartraine? region in France (figure 1). The MUCEP is a pulled-device
	that allows quasi-simultaneous measurements at 50, 100 and 200 cm
	inter-electrodes spacings. We have introduced this geophysical measurement
	(figure 5) into the soil mapping process. This integration was conducted
	in several steps. After using the resistivity contrasts to direct
	auger holes prospection (table 1), we have conducted a statistical
	analysis of the correlations between pedological variables and the
	apparent resistivity by using the point biserial correlation coefficient
	(figure 3, table 4). It makes it possible to simultaneously compare
	the effects of quantitative and qualitative pedological variables
	on resistivity. We demonstrated that apparent resistivity was correlated
	to many soil properties: whereas the resistivity measured with 50
	and 100 cm spacing was mainly correlated to the stone content at
	the soil surface an the depth of limestone, the resistivity measured
	with 200 cm spacing was mainly correlated to the clay layer depth.
	These results were used for plotting the limits between the soil
	map units, according to an explicit decision tree (figure 6) that
	combines, case by case, the use of resistivity measurements with
	expert judgement. The use of point biserial correlation coefficient
	makes it possible to take into account important qualitative variables
	that couldn?t be integrated in Pearson correlation coefficient (table
	2) or linear regression analysis (table C). This study shows that
	the measurement of the soil electrical apparent resistivity with
	MUCEP, together with a simple statistical analysis can provide a
	gain in precision to the soil mapping process (figure 7). This statement
	is of specific interest in the studied geo-pedological context that
	was not favourable for both the soil scientist (figure 4) and the
	geophysicist.}

  abstract = {The use of empirical relationships to calibrate remotely sensed data
	has been reported by many authors, but few studies have been devoted
	to the specific retrieval of soil reflectance and most studies have
	used two calibration targets only, using few (=5) validation targets
	to assess the error in the empirical relationships. Absolute corrections
	based on empirical line methods have seldom been applied to satellite
	data, particularly Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)
	images. In this study, which deals with bare cultivated soils, the
	empirical line method was used to retrieve soil reflectance from
	three programmed SPOT satellite images with 20m and 10m resolution
	based on independent sets of 8 calibration and 15 validation field
	targets of bare soil. The empirical line method was applied to orthorectified
	images with digital number (DN) values interpolated both with the
	cubic convolution and the nearest neighbour interpolation mode. Root
	mean squared errors (RMSEs) between corrected and measured values
	at calibration sites were lower than 0.56% for the two visible bands
	and ranged between 0.61% and 1.97% for the near-infrared band, whereas
	at all validation sites they were mostly lower than 2.5% except for
	most near-infrared bands. Such accurate results have been facilitated
	both by the flat topographical conditions of the Beauce region (Western
	Parisian Basin, France) and the homogeneous sky conditions in a small
	study area (2500ha). Differences in illumination conditions in both
	orbital and field cases did not appear to affect the results dramatically,
	which suggest that even oblique viewing images can be used for such
	correction. Errors could also be due to changes in soil moisture
	and roughness related to soil management practices, or slight vegetation
	growth over the end of the study period. Due to spatial error, the
	20-m resolution with cubic convolution mode led to a much lower performance
	than the 10-m images with either interpolation modes. The achieved
	results are generalizable to European sedimentary basins with loess
	deposits, where similar soils and topographic conditions are to be
	found over thousands of km(2).},
