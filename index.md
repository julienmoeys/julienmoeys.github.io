### Presentation   <a name="presentation"></a>

I am a research engineer in the department 
of [Soil and Environment][SLUSoil] (**[Biogeophysics and Water Quality][BGFVV] 
group**), at the [Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences 
(SLU)][SLU], in [Uppsala][], Sweden.

I work a lot with the [Centre for Chemical Pesticides (CKB)][CKB], 
that provides expertise on the **environmental impact of pesticides** 
used within agriculture to [Swedish stakeholders][CKBRef].

I am the main developer of a **regional scale model for estimating 
the risks of pesticide leaching toward surface- and groundwater** 
from arable land in Sweden ([MACRO-SE][]). I have also developed 
**geographical datasets** (soil properties, crop area) for pesticide 
fate modelling in Sweden.



### Site Content   <a name="sitecontent"></a>

On this website, I present my [curriculum](/en/CV/) and a list of 
[Publications](/en/Publications/) (also on [Google Scholar][jmScholar]). 
You will (soon) find information on the [software](/en/Software/) 
I am developing (mostly R packages), and some technical notes in the 
[IT lab book](/en/ITLabBook/) section (mostly about Ubuntu server 
management).

If you have time to kill, you can also look at my [picture 
gallery][jmFlickr] (Flickr).
